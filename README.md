# Hubert
This project has been DOA for many years. However, this project has served as the foundation of my computer science career. I believe that this project, while very outdated and not my finest work, deserves to be in the public eye.
At the time, I was of the idea that my code had to be hidden unless it was absolutely perfect. Because of this, many of the projects I completed before university were deleted without a second thought. "Don't hide your code" and "the myth of a genius programmer" are some of the best lessons I have ever learned. 

Hubert was a Discord bot written in Discord.js, a NodeJS framework to build Discord bots. It uses an object-oriented approach to managing how commands are ran and maintained.
